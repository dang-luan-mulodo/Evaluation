- **"Always try to complete 「xUnit」 「Review」 「Unit Test (if necessary)」when completing developing task."**
    - Title: Software test automation
    - Summary:
        - Framework testing is very important for software developing. To get improved in software development, you must always try to complete 「xUnit」 「Review」 「Unit Test (if necessary)」when completing developing task 
    - Benefits:
        - Improve the development process of a software product
        - Cost-effective
        - Find Software Bugs Early
        - Facilitates Change
        - Simplifies Integration
        - Provides Documentation         
    - Description:
   		- When developing a software, it is very important to test it before the final phases. In today´s fast moving world, it is a challenge for any company to continuously maintain and improve the quality and efficiency of software systems development. In many software projects, testing is neglected because of time or cost constraints. This leads to a lack of product quality, followed by customer dissatisfaction and ultimately to increased overall quality costs. Test automation can improve the development process of a software product in many cases. The automation of tests is initially associated with increased effort, but the related benefits will quickly pay off. What is Test Automation Why test automation Automated tests can run fast and frequently, which is cost-effective for software products with a long maintenance life. When testing in an agile environment, the ability to quickly react to ever-changing software systems and requirements is necessary. New test cases are generated continuously and can be added to existing automation in parallel to the development of the software itself.
